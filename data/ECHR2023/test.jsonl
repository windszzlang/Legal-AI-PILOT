The report by the D\u00e9fenseur des droits showed that the migrants were living in cramped conditions, with insufficient infrastructure and medical care, suffering from physical and mental exhaustion, adopting a way of life that is more like a survival experiment, and showing signs of conditions that were characteristic of people in situations of very serious instability, combined with disorders specific to migrants and are suffering from post-traumatic syndromes linked to police violence or pressure.\n- In November 2015, an urgent applications judge ordered the prefect of the Pas-de-Calais d\u00e9partement to proceed with the enumeration of unaccompanied minors in distress and to arrange their placement, and also ordered the prefect to set up additional water access points and pit or watertight latrines, a waste collection system, and clear access routes for emergency services which were fully implemented.\n- The context which justified the intervention of the administrative judge for urgent applications in November 2015 had not changed in 2016, and the number of unaccompanied foreign minors living on the heath increased.\n- In February 2016, the prefect of Pas-de-Calais ordered the clearance of the southern part of the heath area.\n- Migrants and non-governmental organizations filed applications for the annulment of the decision.\n- On 25 February 2016, the urgent applications judge suspended the clearance insofar as it would have resulted in the destruction of libraries, schools, and places of worship that had been set up in the area to be vacated, pending a decision on the merits as to the legality of the measure.\n- The clearance of the southern zone was completed on 16 March 2016."}

He contested the election results citing various irregularities and lodged an action to invalidate the election, which was dismissed by various courts. The case is currently pending before the Administrative Court of Appeal.\n- The second applicant was charged with premeditated murder and illegal possession of firearms in 2011 and was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2012. The decision was quashed by the Supreme Court in 2016 due to insufficient reasoning and the case was remitted for re-examination. The Shkodra Court of Appeal then upheld the conviction for premeditated murder, and the case is currently awaiting examination of the cassation appeal by the Supreme Court.\n- Albania underwent justice system reforms in 2016, leading to a re-evaluation of all serving judges and prosecutors, including those in the Supreme Court. The process resulted in the dismissal of many judges, leading to a shortage of judges in the Supreme Court and a significant backlog of cases.\n- The Supreme Court introduced a new remedy in the Code of Civil Procedure in 2017 in response to the Court's leading judgment in Luli and Others v. Albania regarding the unreasonable length of proceedings. The new remedy allows the court to examine requests for just satisfaction from a person who has suffered pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage on account of the unreasonable length of proceedings."}

An investigator refused to open a criminal case into Mr Topal\u2019s death, stating it was self-inflicted.\n9. The applicants appealed against the refusal, which was discontinued.\n10. The district court dismissed the applicant's appeal, and the investigators refused to open a fully-fledged investigation.\n11. The applicant's husband, Mr Shaposhnikov, was arrested for an administrative offense and taken to a police station.\n12. Mr Shaposhnikov was released, re-arrested following a fight, and found dead the next day.\n13. The post-mortem examination revealed a closed injury to the head sustained one to three days before his death.\n14. Two additional examinations found bruises on both eyes, bottom lip, and forehead, with two haematomas, including one inflicted between one and two weeks before death.\n15. An expert group confirmed the previous findings and concluded that the head injury was inflicted ten to fourteen days before Mr Shaposhnikov\u2019s death.\n16. The investigators refused to open a criminal case, which was subsequently quashed by their superiors.\n17. The authorities charged the applicant\u2019s brother, Mr. L., with infliction of injuries, but he was acquitted for lack of evidence.\n18. Mr. I. was convicted of inflicting the injuries that subsequently caused Mr. Shaposhnikov's death.\n19. The applicant's brother, Mr. Drozdov, was arrested for a misdemeanour and taken to police station no. 4.\n20. Mr. Drozdov \"behaved loudly\" and was tied up; the officers left him tied in that position, and he died soon after.\n21. The investigators twice refused to open a criminal case, which was quashed by their superiors.\n22. The investigators eventually opened a criminal case, which was terminated multiple times before the officers were charged with abuse of power"}

The case involves the domestic authorities' failure to secure the applicant's contact with his son.\n2. The applicant's son was born in 2012 from his marriage to Ms. Ye.\n3. The marriage was dissolved in 2014.\n4. The Sovetskiy District Court of Tambov determined A.'s residence as being with his mother in 2015.\n5. The Michurinsk Town Court of the Tambov Region determined the contact arrangement between the applicant and his son, which was upheld on appeal in 2016.\n6. The Michurinsk District Bailiffs' Service instituted enforcement proceedings on 4 October 2016.\n7. Bailiffs in charge of enforcement accompanied the applicant to Ye.'s place of residence on numerous occasions between 2016 and 2021 to assist with enforcement, but to no avail.\n8. Enforcement fees were recovered from Ye. on twenty-five occasions in 2017-2018 for failure to comply with the judgment.\n9. The Michurinsk Juvenile Commission examined 71 reports against Ye. for preventing the child from communicating with the applicant and imposed 56 administrative fines on Ye. in 2016-2021.\n10. Ye. was temporarily restricted from leaving the territory of the Russian Federation to secure enforcement.\n11. Various organizations were involved in facilitating enforcement from child protection departments to psychologists.\n12. None of the above measures led to the enforcement of the judgment, with Ye continuing to resist enforcement.\n13. The applicant applied for court proceedings to restrict Ye.'s parental authority on 9 September 2020.\n14. The Michurinsk Town Prosecutor considered there were no grounds for restricting Ye.'s parental authority, and the applicant challenged the decision in administrative proceedings.\n15. The final decision on the matter was taken by a judge of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation on 28 July 2021.\n16. The bailiff applied for termination of the enforcement proceedings on 21 April 2021, but the Town Court rejected the request on 14 May 2021.\n17. During the latest attempt at enforcement on 15 May 2021, the child refused to have contact with the applicant.\n18. The Michurinsk Juvenile Commission refused the applicant's request to initiate proceedings for restriction or deprivation of Ye.'s parental authority on 25 May 2021.\n19.

The liquidator registered the applicant company's claim, which was then challenged by a different creditor, with the final list contested, urging the applicant's removal.\n7. Domestic courts ruled against the applicant company's claim, in favour of the other creditor, and removed the claim, stating that the applicant company had to have been aware of the proceedings, which was confirmed when the managing director joined his claim to the statement of affairs.\n8. The applicant company submitted three final decisions from 2018 to the Court, indicating contradictory domestic case-law in similar cases, and that notifying the managing director in his personal capacity of bankruptcy proceedings doesn't satisfy the legal requirement for notification to the company.\n9. The Government countered that there was no divergent case-law, with courts deeming that failure to notify creditors in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure meant their claims were received within the time-limit as a right, regardless of other means of awareness, with some holding that claims must be lodged with the least amount of delay once the creditor is aware of the proceeding.\n10. Government asserts that even though the applicant company was not properly notified, they were aware of the bankruptcy proceedings through their managing director, who was a private creditor, and their inaction resulted in losing their claim."}

The case concerns non-enforcement of court decisions regarding the contact schedule between the applicant and his child.\n2. The couple got married in 2006 and had a daughter in 2008. They got a divorce in 2013, and the court awarded joint custody to both parents, with the child's residence with the mother and contact rights for the father.\n3. Despite seeking help from a bailiff office, enforcement attempts by the applicant to exercise his contact rights remained unsuccessful due to X hindering his efforts, and the new bailiff concluding that the child refused to see the applicant.\n4. The child-protection authority requested psychological counseling for Y based on the bailiff's report in 2016, which ordered X to comply with the measures that the psychologist would indicate.\n5. The G\u0103e\u015fti District Court set a new contact arrangement a year later following Y's eighth birthday, allowing the applicant to see the child every other weekend, half of school holidays, and other significant days in the year.\n6. X refused to take the child to counseling, claiming that the court decision whose enforcement was sought was no longer in force and replaced by the new decision of 2016.\n7. The applicant started new enforcement proceedings through the same bailiff but remained unable to see his child, and penalties for non-enforcement were sought.\n8. The Bucharest District Court stayed the enforcement proceedings upon X's request, finding that she did not oppose contact, but the child refused.\n9. The applicant lodged a new request seeking to modify the contact schedule, and these proceedings were pending on the date of the Government's observations in 2021.\n10. The applicant sought an interim order setting the child's residence with him during the new proceedings, which was dismissed for lacking urgency.\n11. The applicant made further attempts to see his child but remained unsuccessful.\n12. The applicant complained that he was unable to exercise his parental rights and see his child due to a series of failures by the competent authorities, relying on Article 8 of the Convention."}

She also had a bruise on her upper lip, haematomas on her wrists, arms, lower legs and knees and small abrasions around her ankles.\n- On 24 February 2013, the applicant consulted a surgeon due to persistent numbness in her wrists, and the surgeon requested a neurological examination.\n- It appears from the case file that the security camera recordings from the police station had already been erased by the time they had been requested on 7 March 2013, and the attempts to contact the bartender from the restaurant had been unsuccessful.\n- By letters of the Prague I District Police Directorate, dated 28 March 2013, and the Prague II District Police Directorate, dated 8 April 2013, the applicant was informed that her complaint, considered under Article 175 \u00a7 5 of the Administrative Code, had been declared ill-founded.\n- None of the official reports or statements of the police officers involved or of the head doctor of the sobering-up centre had confirmed the assertions described in the criminal complaint."}

A psychologist was appointed to assist E. and evaluate the situation with his parents. \n7. The court ordered the first applicant not to expose the minor to her partner, admonished her for hindering J.'s access rights, and appointed a psychologist to assess the minor children. \n8. The first applicant objected to J.'s request to take custody of E. and requested a variation of the court order. \n9. The court dismissed the request without holding a hearing. \n10. The court-appointed psychologist submitted a report suggesting that the life E. had with both parents could be beneficial if they were more cooperative, and that they would benefit from assistance by a parental coach or family therapist. \n11. An interim measure was issued by the Civil Court (First Hall) allowing E. to be close to the applicants in the time after their child's birth. \n12. On appeal, the Constitutional Court annulled that part of the judgment finding a breach of Article 8 and the breach of Article 6 in respect of the second applicant, but affirmed the remaining violation of Article 6 as upheld by the first-instance court."}

The applicant was referred to by name in media coverage, causing him to receive queries and criticism.\n4.

The defendant had lacked any basis to attribute the destruction of the laptop to the applicant.\n7.

The courts found that although the defendant himself had not mentioned the applicant's name, his statements had allowed for the applicant's identification and the defendant had not discouraged his staff from revealing the applicant's name.\n9. The Supreme Court quashed the judgment of the appellate court and considered the applicant a public person, thus allowing for protected speech under Article 10 of the Convention.\n10. The Warsaw Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's action, ordering him to pay costs and fees.\n11. The applicant did not appeal again.\n12.
