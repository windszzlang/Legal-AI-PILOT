The applicants brought a judicial review, arguing that the decision was unlawful and should be quashed.\n- The Burgas District Court quashed the decision of the land commission and held that the applicants were entitled to have the 879 square meters of land restored \"in actual boundaries\". It found that the applicants were entitled to the restitution of the land and there was no evidence to establish that any lawful construction works were carried out prior to the ALA's entry into force.\n- The Stara Zagora municipality contested the lower courts' conclusion that it had not itself become an owner of the land. The Supreme Court pointed out that former owners of agricultural land were not entitled to restitution in kind where construction carried out on it prevented its return.\n- The Regional Court dismissed the applicants' rei vindicatio claim, accepting the Stara Zagora municipality's objection that section 10b of the ALA prohibited restitution of land in cases where \"a complex of construction works\" had been put in place on the plot.\n- The Supreme Court of Cassation upheld the Regional Court's judgment, finding that the land could not be returned to its former owners due to the presence of permanent and temporary buildings forming part of a \"complex of construction works.\" The applicants did not seek compensation in lieu of restitution."}

He was diagnosed with sluggish schizophrenia, which he had developed during military service. On those grounds, he was released from military service.\n- By 2005 he had been treated in psychiatric institutions no less than fifteen times. In 2004 he was diagnosed with residual and then paranoid schizophrenia.\n- In February 2006 the applicant attempted suicide by setting himself on fire. He was admitted to the trauma unit of a hospital.\n- The prosecutor's request for information was replied to on 14 November 2006 by the Akmen\u0117 District Psychiatric Health Centre, which confirmed that the applicant had been attending there since 1999, and was being treated for schizophrenia. In 2004 episodes of the applicant\u2019s illness had become more frequent. That year the applicant attempted to commit suicide; he did not accept that he was ill. He was admitted to the \u0160iauliai Psychiatric Hospital, where he spent about a month before being released for outpatient care at his own request. Since July 2005 the applicant stopped attending the Akmen\u0117 District Psychiatric Health Centre and taking his medication, because he firmly refused any consultations with the psychiatrists.\n- On 24 November 2006, the applicant's mother asked a prosecutor to initiate proceedings with a view to her son being declared legally incapacitated.\n- By a ruling of 29 November 2006, the Akmen\u0117 District Court ordered an expert examination to ascertain whether the applicant was suffering from mental illness, whether he could understand his actions, and whether he could take part in court proceedings.\n- The psychiatrist concluded that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia.

The case concerns the investigation into the death of the applicant\u2019s son.\n2. A powerful explosion occurred at the facilities of Grme\u010d on 23 June 1995.\n3. The explosion was caused by the covert production of composite solid rocket fuel under the auspices of the State Intelligence Service.\n4. Composite fuel is a broad class of solid chemical fuels that are used as propellants in rockets and require a specialized location with a high level of preventive measures and safety precautions.\n5. An Intelligence Service executive had agreed to the production of rocket fuel with a private company, JPL Systems.\n6. On 23 June 1995, most of the components were blended together in a batch mixer in another company, transported in aluminum bins to Grme\u010d in a private car by JPL experts and stored next to the mill.\n7. When the mixture was put on the mill and extraction of the sheets of rocket fuel started, an explosion occurred in the presence of more than twenty workers from the two commissioned companies.\n8. The explosion resulted in the death of the applicant\u2019s son and ten other people, while ten others were seriously injured.\n9. Neither Grme\u010d nor JPL was licensed and adequately equipped for the production of rocket fuel at the material time.\n10. The post-mortem examination of victims\u2019 bodies was carried out between 24 and 26 June 1995 by the Institute for Forensic Medicine of the Faculty of Medicine in Belgrade.\n11. On 24 June 1995 the Belgrade police ex officio set up a commission to examine the cause of the explosion.\n12. Following site inspections between 23 and 26 June 1995 and computer simulations of the explosions, two experts from the Security Institute submitted their report to the DDPO on 9 August 1995, which stated that the explosion appeared to have been initially caused by the heat generated by the mill\u2019s rollers during the production of composite fuel.\n13. The applicant lodged a criminal complaint against a number of senior executives of Grme\u010d and JPL in March 1996.\n14. The experts\u2019 report of 9 August 1995 was served on the applicant on 15 April 1996, and he posed several questions and objections.\n15. The court appointed the Belgrade Chemistry Faculty to determine the cause of the explosion, whether it could have been avoided, and the possible liability in that respect."}

(the first and second applicants\u2019 son, and the third applicant\u2019s brother).\n4. The applicants and V.M. were provided with four plots of land in Vilnius in June/July 2001. \n5. In August/September 2001, the applicants sold their plots to third parties for LTL 25,000 each. \n6. In October 2001, a pre-trial investigation was opened concerning allegations of fraud in connection with the restoration of property rights in the Vilnius Region. \n7. V.M. was interviewed as a witness during the investigation and made statements which were later retracted.\n8. The prosecutor lodged a claim in January 2002 asking for the administrative decisions to be overturned due to the applicants having received priority rights unlawfully.\n9. The court found that the applicants had the right to receive one plot of land of up to 0.2 ha, instead of the three plots they had received, and overturned the administrative decisions.\n10. The applicants were ordered to return the plots of land they had received, and to pay the State the market value of that land, estimated to be LTL 216,000 (EUR 62,560) each, for a total of LTL 648,000 (EUR 187,680).\n11. The applicants appealed against the judgment but their appeal was dismissed by the Vilnius Regional Court.\n12. The Supreme Court also dismissed their cassation appeal.\n13. The applicants submitted a claim against the State for pecuniary damages but this was also dismissed by the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court and the Supreme Administrative Court."}

The applicant intervened and made remarks that R.M. considered defamatory, leading him to institute civil proceedings against the applicant.\n- During the television show, the applicant expressed her opinion that Constan\u0163a city was divided between two clans or gangs, namely \"M.'s men and those who were against M.\", and that R.M. had connections with the V. brothers, who were allegedly behind the violent incident in August 2006.\n- R.M. filed a civil complaint against the applicant, seeking a public letter of apology, the publication of the final judgment in two newspapers, and non-pecuniary damages of 200,000 RON.

She also argued that the sanction imposed by the court was excessive and lacked appropriate reasoning and justifying criteria."}
